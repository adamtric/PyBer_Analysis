# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to help Pyber to understand the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, riders, fares, and more. This analysis will help Pyber understand affordability for under-served neighborhoods through the use of data frames and visualizations.

## Results

Based on the data from all three of the city types, we can conclude each city type has a different level of demand for the Pyber service. As we can see in the Summary Data Frame, we can see that the number of rides in each city type varies. Rural cities accumulated a total of 125 rides, Suburban cities accumulated 625 rides and Urban cities accumulated 1,625 rides. These levels tell us that more people are using Pyber in Urban cities as compared to Suburban and Rural cities.

With the differing levels of total rides, it makes sense that the total number of drivers in each city type would differ as well. We can see that Rural cities had the smallest number of drivers and Urban cities had the most drivers. This showcases that drivers have recognized there is more opportunity to grow their own business within Urban cities. However, we can see that there were more drivers than total rides in Urban cities. This was the only city type where this was the case, showcasing increased levels of competition for drivers in this city type.

It is interesting to see, however, that Rural city types have generated a higher average fair per ride and average fare per driver as compared to Suburban and Urban city types. There appears to be a differing level of pricing within Rural city types as compared to the others.

These differing levels of demand is also showcased in the total fares generaged by each city type. Rural cities have generated $4,327.93 in fares, Suburban cities have generated $19,356.33 in fares and Urban cities have generated $39,854.38 in fares. Visually, according to our line chart, we can see that Rural cities fall well behind in terms of total fares as compared to Suburban and Urban cities.

## Summary

After seeing the results of the analysis, there a few business decisions that could be made to address some of the disparities among the cities. The first one is pricing. It seems like the prices and the average fares per ride within each city type should be equalized. If Pyber can equalize the average fare per ride for each city type, perhaps lowering the prices for Rural cities, and raising the prices for Urban cities, the organization could see an increase in demand for Rural cities while taking advantage of the high demand within Urban cities. Putting in place a dynamic pricing model would be a good idea.

Pyber needs to increase demand for Rural and suburban cities, and must showcase the value it can bring to riders in these under-served communities. By offering discount codes or rewards programs in these cities, Pyber may be able to increase the amount of people who are using Pyber. Offering these will increase demand and total rides, and should bring an increase in total drivers as well as fare numbers.

There is also an opportunity to attract more drivers within under-served communities. Pyber should want their service to be very efficient and this can only be achieved with a larger number of drivers as a large number of drivers should naturally decrease the wait time for rides. Suburban and Rural cities have less drivers than total rides. In order to attract more drivers for these cities, Pyber should be finding ways to reward their drivers. Perhaps by providing their drivers with added benefits or their own special rewards, Pyber should be able to attract more drivers.
